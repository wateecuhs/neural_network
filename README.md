# Neural Network

Building a neural network library from scratch in C to learn how they work

## Current tasks

- Cleaning up the code so its more flexible and library-like.
- Batches

## Current progress

- Single digit OCR works, which was the original goal of this project

- Implemented basic MLP with dense layers
- Activations: ReLU, Sigmoid, Softmax
- Loss: Categorical Cross-Entropy
- Optimizers: Stochastic Gradient Descent (single sample at a time)

## Todo

- ONNX Model saving/loading
- Implement batches for SGD
- Graphical interface for single digit OCR with input frame and NN representation
